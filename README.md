# PokedexAndroidApp

This app is a simple Android app using the PokeApi graphql api. I've never used Apollo before so I figured this would be a good time to try it out. I've been debating if this project is big enough to warrant the setup and use of dagger. I'm using compose for the UI (hopefully strictly), but may switch to a recycler view for the pokedex activity as it's a bit more performant. I'll continue to update this as I work on it and it gets closer to completion to talk a bit more about my approaches.
